    <p id="intro">Rajasthani cuisine is a resourceful and flavourful art, perfected by the arid climate and the historical needs of its warriors. Dominated by slow-cooked curries, ingenious use of lentils and pulses, and rich use of ghee (clarified butter), every bite is a historical treat.</p>

    <h1><b>Dal Baati Churma</b></h2>
    <p class="dis">The Iconic Trio. Baati (hard, baked wheat rolls) is dipped in melted ghee and eaten with spicy Dal (lentil curry) and a sweet, coarsely ground dessert called Churma. A truly wholesome, fulfilling, and essential Rajasthani meal.</p>

    <h1><b>Laal Maas (Red Meat)</b></h2>
    <p class="dis">The ultimate non-vegetarian delicacy from the royal kitchens. This fiery mutton curry gets its rich red colour and heat from copious amounts of Mathania red chillies, balanced by curd and aromatic spices. Not for the faint of heart, but unforgettable.</p>

    <h1><b>Gatte Ki Sabzi</b></h2>
    <p class="dis">A popular vegetarian curry where roundels of steamed and fried chickpea flour (besan) dumplings (gatte) are simmered in a rich, tangy gravy made of curd and spices. A testament to desert cooking where fresh vegetables were scarce.</p>

    <h1><b>Sweets & Desserts</b></h2>
    <p class="dis">Rajasthan is a paradise for those with a sweet tooth. Must-try items include the honeycomb-like crisp sweet Ghevar (especially during Teej) and the milk-cake favourite, Alwar Ka Kalakand.</p>
