    <h1><b>The Turban (Pagri/Safa)</b></h2>
    <p class="dis">More than headgear, the safa is a symbol of pride, honour, and one's place in society. The style, colour, and folds of the turban change with the region, season, and occasion (e.g., Pink for Jaipur, Golden for Jaisalmer, White for mourning). Guests are often offered a turban as a mark of respect.</p>
